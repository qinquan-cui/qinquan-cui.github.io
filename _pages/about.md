Welcome! I am a third year PhD student at the [UCL School of Management](https://www.mgmt.ucl.ac.uk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, University College London, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Kenan ArifoÄŸlu and Professor Dongyuan Zhan. My research is notably centered on understanding the intricate dynamics of information asymmetry within pharmaceutical markets and the impact of legal frameworks on ensuring the availability and affordability of medicine.
